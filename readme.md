## Workflow & Examples

### 1. Movie Stream Flow

Movies only require the `subject_id`:

1. **Search Title**:
   ```http
   GET /search?q=Avatar
   ```
2. **Resolve 1080p Streams**:
   ```http
   GET /api/stream/8906247916759695608
   ```
3. **Fetch Subtitles**:
   ```http
   GET /api/stream/8906247916759695608/captions
   ```

### 2. TV Series Episode Stream Flow

TV series require checking available seasons and episodes first, then querying with `se` (season) and `ep` (episode) query parameters:

1. **Search Series**:
   ```http
   GET /search?q=Breaking+Bad
   ```
2. **Retrieve Season & Episode Breakdown**:
   ```http
   GET /episodes/6207982430134357800
   ```
   *Response:*
   ```json
   {
     "subject_id": "6207982430134357800",
     "seasons": [
       {"season": 1, "episode_count": 7},
       {"season": 2, "episode_count": 13},
       {"season": 3, "episode_count": 13},
       {"season": 4, "episode_count": 13},
       {"season": 5, "episode_count": 16}
     ]
   }
   ```
3. **Resolve Streams for a Specific Episode** (e.g. Season 1, Episode 1):
   ```http
   GET /api/stream/6207982430134357800?se=1&ep=1
   ```
   *Querying Season 1, Episode 2:*
   ```http
   GET /api/stream/6207982430134357800?se=1&ep=2
   ```
4. **Fetch Subtitles for that Episode**:
   ```http
   GET /api/stream/6207982430134357800/captions?se=1&ep=1
   ```
